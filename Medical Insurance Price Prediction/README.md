I have to perform data analytics on a medical insurance charges dataaset. 
This is a filtered and modified version of the Medical Insurance Price Prediction dataset, available under the CC0 1.0 Universal License on the Kaggle website.

<h5>About Dataset

Overview of the dataset:
The medical insurance dataset contains information about a number of factors that can affect medical expenses, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region. This dataset can be used to train a machine learning model that can predict medical expenses for new customers.

To provide insights into the key factors that contribute to higher insurance costs and help the company make more informed decisions regarding pricing and risk assessment.

The dataset contains 2.7K rows and 7 columns
Columns include

Age
Sex
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Children
Smoker
Region
Charges


>> Problem Statement:

What are the most important factors that affect medical expenses?
How well can machine learning models predict medical expenses?
How can machine learning models be used to improve the efficiency and profitability of health insurance companies?

>> Objectives
>> 
In this project, you will:

Load the data as a pandas dataframe
Clean the data, taking care of the blank entries
Run exploratory data analysis and identify the attributes that most affect the charges
Develop single variable and multi variable Linear Regression models for predicting the charges
Use Ridge regression to refine the performance of Linear regression models.
